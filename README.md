# PhD Guided Study Repository

This repository contains materials and progress related to the **Guided Study Discipline** during the first year of my PhD program.

## Contents

The repository focuses on developing approaches and solutions within the discipline, particularly targeting challenges in data provenance in LLMs, Integer Programming and resource management.

## Key Considerations

The study is framed around the following core factors:

- **Data Provenance for LLMs Tasks**: Data Provenance for LLMs aims traceability, accountability, and reproducibility by documenting the origins, transformations and and usage of datasets in model training and evaluation.
  - Summarization and its text transformations
- **Integer Programming with a Multi-objective Approach**: Applying advanced mathematical modeling to address and balance competing objectives.
  - **Time**: How to optimize processing time and operational efficiency.
  - **Cost (Financial)**: Minimizing financial expenditures while achieving project goals.
  - **Energy Consumption**: Reducing energy usage for sustainable and efficient solutions.

## Goals

- To explore innovative methods in multi-objective optimization.
- To document and share progress on practical implementations.
- To contribute to the academic discourse through reproducible research.
